# Applying userinput to our work 
## **Interaction Instructions**
To engage with the animation, move your mouse across the canvas to trigger color changes for the small dots. For more dynamic interaction:

- Press the Space key to initiate a special drawing sequence with expanding circles.
- Press the Enter key to reset the animation back to its initial state.

Each interaction, whether through mouse movement or keypress, modifies the visual output to create a lively, randomized art experience.

## **Personal Approach to the Animation Code**
In crafting this code, I aimed to blend interactivity with procedural randomness. By using a mix of mouse interactions and keyboard events, the code creates a dynamic and immersive visual experience. The use of randomly generated colors for each small circle and a rotating sequence of circles in different locations adds complexity and encourages exploration of the canvas.

## **Chosen Animation Drivers: Interaction and Time**
My primary drivers in this animation are user interaction and timed intervals. Mouse actions trigger random color changes, while timed intervals manage the expansion of concentric circles. This choice allows the artwork to evolve over time, with user input serving as an additional layer of control.

## **Animated Image Properties**

**1.Color Change**: The small dots change color when the mouse is clicked, adding a randomized visual element.

**2.Expanding Circles**: Upon pressing the Space key, circles begin to expand at set intervals, creating a growing pattern across the canvas.

**3.Particle Movement**: Particles are animated to move across the screen, disappearing once they reach the edge, which maintains a clean and ongoing flow of new elements.

**Difference in Animation with Group Member**: Another group member's animation visually emphasizes randomness and variability, creating a richer dynamic effect through time control and mouse interaction. In contrast, my animation mainly relies on direct key input, providing more user-driven control but with less visual randomness and variation.

## **inspiration sources**
The primary inspiration for my animation’s extended effects came from Erik Söderberg's Geometric GIFs. His looping art pieces, featuring various geometric shapes and patterns, demonstrate how shapes can transform into mesmerizing cyclic visuals. This inspired me to incorporate similar circular expansions and rotations in my animation. His GIFs possess a visually immersive quality, with layered elements and rotational effects, which led me to recreate this complexity by combining layered particle movements and rotations with different colors.
