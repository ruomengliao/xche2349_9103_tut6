#### Applying userinput to our work **Bold Text**
## Interaction Instructions
To engage with the animation, move your mouse across the canvas to trigger color changes for the small dots. For more dynamic interaction:

Press the Space key to initiate a special drawing sequence with expanding circles.
Press the Enter key to reset the animation back to its initial state.
Each interaction, whether through mouse movement or keypress, modifies the visual output to create a lively, randomized art experience.

## Personal Approach to the Animation Code **Bold Text**
In crafting this code, I aimed to blend interactivity with procedural randomness. By using a mix of mouse interactions and keyboard events, the code creates a dynamic and immersive visual experience. The use of randomly generated colors for each small circle and a rotating sequence of circles in different locations adds complexity and encourages exploration of the canvas.

## Chosen Animation Drivers: Interaction and Time **Bold Text**
My primary drivers in this animation are user interaction and timed intervals. Mouse actions trigger random color changes, while timed intervals manage the expansion of concentric circles. This choice allows the artwork to evolve over time, with user input serving as an additional layer of control.

## Animated Image Properties **Bold Text**
**Bold Text**Color Change: The small dots change color when the mouse is clicked, adding a randomized visual element.
Expanding Circles: Upon pressing the Space key, circles begin to expand at set intervals, creating a growing pattern across the canvas.
**Bold Text**Particle Movement: Particles are animated to move across the screen, disappearing once they reach the edge, which maintains a clean and ongoing flow of new elements.
